<a name="event"></a>
### Event
**Note** The Event definition will be externalized in future versions 
of this document.

A basic payload of an Event. The actual schema is dependent on the 
information configured for the EventType, as is its enforcement 
(see POST /event-types). Setting of metadata properties are
dependent on the configured enrichment as well.

For explanation on default configurations of validation and enrichment, 
see documentation of `EventType.category`.

For concrete examples of what will be enforced by Nakadi see the 
objects BusinessEvent and DataChangeEvent below.

*Type* : object


<a name="eventmetadata"></a>
### EventMetadata
Metadata for this Event.

Contains commons fields for both Business and DataChange Events. Most 
are enriched by Nakadi upon reception, but they in general might be 
set by the client.

<a name="eventstreambatch"></a>
### EventStreamBatch
One chunk of events in a stream. A batch consists of an array of 
`Event`s plus a `Cursor` pointing to the offset of the last Event 
in the stream.

The size of the array of Event is limited by the parameters used to 
initialize a Stream.

If acting as a keep alive message (see `GET /event-type/{name}/events`) 
the events array will be omitted.

Sequential batches might present repeated cursors if no new events 
have arrived.

|**events**  <br>*optional*||< [Event](definitions.md#event) > array|

### EventType
An event type defines the schema and its runtime properties.


|Name|Description|Schema|
|---|---|---|
|**category**  <br>*required*|Defines the category of this EventType.<br><br>The value set will influence, if not set otherwise, the default <br>set of validation-strategies, enrichment-strategies, and the effective <br>schema for validation in the following way:<br><br>- `undefined`: No predefined changes apply. The effective schema for <br>the validation is exactly the same as the `EventTypeSchema`.<br>  Default validation_strategy for this `EventType` is `['schema-validation']`.<br><br>- `data`: Events of this category will be DataChangeEvents. The <br>effective schema during the validation contains `metadata`,<br>  and adds fields `data_op` and `data_type`. The passed <br>  EventTypeSchema defines the schema of `data`.<br><br>- `business`: Events of this category will be BusinessEvents. The <br>effective schema for validation contains `metadata` and any <br>additionally defined properties passed in the `EventTypeSchema` <br>directly on top level of the Event. If name conflicts arise, creation <br>of this EventType will be rejected. Default validation_strategy for <br>this `EventType` is `['schema-validation']`.|enum (undefined, data, business)|
|**data_key_fields**  <br>*optional*|Indicators of the path of the properties that constitute the primary <br>key (identifier) of the data within this Event.<br>If set MUST be a valid required field as defined in the schema.<br>(TBD should be required? Is applicable only to both Business and <br>DataChange Events?)|< string > array|
|**default_statistics**  <br>*optional*|Statistics of this EventType used for optimization purposes. Internal <br>use of these values might change over time.|object|
|**enrichment_strategies**  <br>*optional*|Determines the enrichment to be performed on an Event upon reception. <br>Enrichment is performed once upon reception (and after validation) of <br>an Event and is only possible on fields that are not defined on the <br>incoming Event.<br><br>For event types in categories 'business' or 'data' it's mandatory to <br>use METADATA_ENRICHMENT strategy. For 'undefined' event types it's <br>not possible to use this strategy, since metadata field is not required.<br><br>See documentation for the write operation for details on behaviour <br>in case of unsuccessful enrichment.|< enum (METADATA_ENRICHMENT) > array|
|**name**  <br>*required*|Name of this EventType. Encodes the owner/responsible for this EventType.  <br>**Example** : `"order.ORDER_CANCELLED"`|string|

|**partition_key_fields**  <br>*optional*|Required when 'partition_resolution_strategy' is set to 'hash'. Must <br>be absent otherwise. Indicates the fields used for evaluatiion the <br>partition of Events of this type.<br><br>If set it MUST be a valid required field as defined in the schema.|< string > array|
|**partition_strategy**  <br>*optional*|Determines how the assignment of the event to a partition <br>should be handled.<br><br>For details of possible values, see GET /registry/partition-strategies.  <br>**Default** : `"random"`|string|
|**schema**  <br>*required*|The schema for this EventType. Submitted events will be validated <br>against it.|object|
|**validation_strategies**  <br>*optional*|Determines the validation that has to be executed upon reception of <br>Events of this type. Events are rejected if any of the rules fail <br>(see details of Problem response on the Event publishing methods).<br><br>Rule evaluation order is the same as in this array.<br><br>If not explicitly set, default value will respect the definition <br>of the `EventType.category`.|< string > array|
