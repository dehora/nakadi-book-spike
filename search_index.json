is a distributed, open source event broker. The project is being developed by Zalando and is available on Github. \nWhy Nakadi?\nThe goal of Nakadi is to enable convenient development of event-driven applications and asynchronous microservices by allowing producers to publish streams of event data to multiple consumers, without direct integration. It does this by exposing a HTTP API to let microservices to maintain their boundaries and not force a particular technology dependency on producers and consumers - if you can speak HTTP you can use Nakadi.\nOperations is also a factor behind Nakadi&#39;s design. Managing upgrades to systems like Kafka becomes easier when technology sits behind an API and isn&#39;t a shared dependency between microservices. Asychronous event delivery can be a simpler overall option for a microservice architecture compared to synchronized and deep call paths that have to be mitigated with caches, bulkheads and circuit breakers. \nThe section &quot;Comparison to Other Systems&quot; describes Nakadi relative to systems such as Apache Kafka, AWS Kinesis, Google Pub/Sub and Azure EventHub.\nFeatures\n\nA secured HTTP API. This allows microservices teams to maintain service boundaries, and not directly depend on any specific message broker technology. Access to the API can be managed and secured using OAuth scopes.\n\nAn event type registry. Events sent to Nakadi can be defined with a schema and managed via a registry. Events can be validated before they are distributed to consumers.\n\nInbuilt event types. Nakadi also has optional support for events describing business processes and data changes using standard primitives for identity, timestamps, event types, and causality. \n\nLow latency event delivery. Once a publisher sends an event using a simple HTTP POST, consumers can be pushed to via a streaming HTTP connection, allowing near real-time event processing. The consumer connection has keepalive controls and support for managing stream offsets. \n\nCompatibility with the STUPS project. STUPS is Zalando&#39;s open source platform infrastructure for running and securing microservices on AWS.\n\nBuilt on proven infrastructure. Nakadi uses the excellent Apache Kafka as its internal message broker and the also excellent PostgreSQL as a backing database. \n\n\nContributing\nNakadi accepts contributions from the open-source community. Please see the \n project issue tracker for things to work on.\nBefore making a contribution, please let us know by posting a comment to the relevant issue. And if you would like to propose a new feature, do start a new issue explaining the feature youâ€™d like to contribute.\nAbout\nThis book is generated using Gitbook and published to GitHub Pages via a Travis CI build.

If you don&#39;t have Docker \ninstalled, there are great instructions available on \nthe Docker website. \nRunning a Server\nFrom the project&#39;s home directory you can install and start a Nakadi container \nvia the gradlew command:\n./gradlew startDockerContainer\n\nThis will start a docker container for the Nakadi server and another container \nwith its PostgreSQL, Kafka and Zookeeper dependencies. You can read more about \nthe gradlew script in the Building and Developing section\nStopping a Server\nTo stop the running Nakadi:\n./gradlew stopAndRemoveDockerContainer\n\n\nNotes\nIf you&#39;re having trouble getting started, you might find an answer in the\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section of the documentation. \nPorts\nSome ports need to be available to run the service: \n\n8080 for the API server\n5432 for PostgreSQL\n9092 for Kafka \n2181 for Zookeeper \n\nThey allow the services to communicate with each other and should not be used \nby other applications. \nMac OS and Docker\nSince Docker for Mac OS runs inside Virtual Box, you will  want to expose \nsome ports first to allow Nakadi to access its dependencies -\ndocker-machine ssh default \\\n-L 9092:localhost:9092 \\\n-L 8080:localhost:8080 \\\n-L 5432:localhost:5432 \\\n-L 2181:localhost:2181\n\nAlternatively you can set up port forwarding on the &quot;default&quot; machine through \nits network settings in the VirtualBox UI, which look like this - \n\n"},"docs/using.html":{"url":"docs/using.html","title":"Using Nakadi","body":"Using Nakadi\nIn this section we&#39;ll walk through using Nakadi to produce and consume events, and describe the main concepts. \n\nConcepts\nEvent Types\nProducing Events\nConsuming Events\n\nThe section, &quot;API Reference&quot; contains a detailed description of the API.\n"},"docs/using/concepts.html":{"url":"docs/using/concepts.html","title":"Concepts","body":"Nakadi Concepts\nThe Nakadi API allows the publishing and consuming of events over HTTP. \nA good way to think of events is that they are like messages in a stream processing or queuing system, but have a defined structure that can be understood and validated. The object containing the information describing an event is called an event type.\nTo publish and consume events, an owning application must first register a new event type with Nakadi. The event type contains information such as its name, the aforementioed owning application, strategies for partitioning and enriching data, and a JSON Schema. Nakadi supports an event type registry API that lists all the available event types.\nOnce the event type is created, a resource called a stream becomes available for that event type. The stream will accept events for the type from a producer and can be read from by one or more consumers. Nakadi can validate each event that is sent to the stream.\nAn event type&#39;s stream can be divided into one or more partitions. Each event is placed into exactly one partition. Each partition represents an ordered log - once an event is added to a partition its position is never changed, but there is no global ordering across partitions [1]. \nConsumers can read events and track their position in the stream using a cursor that is given to each partition. Consumers can also use a cursor to read from a stream at a particular position. Multiple consumers can read from the same stream, allowing different applications to read the stream simultaneously. \nIn summary, applications using Nakadi can be grouped as follows: \n\nEvent Type Owners: Event type owners interact with Nakadi via the event type registry to define event types based on a schema and create event streams. \n\nEvent Producers: Producers publish events to the event type&#39;s stream, that conform to the event type&#39;s schema.\n\nEvent Consumers: Consumers read events from the event stream. Multiple consumers can read from the same stream.\n\n\n\n\n[1] For more detail on partitions and the design of streams see &quot;The Log&quot; by Jay Kreps.\n"},"docs/using/event-types.html":{"url":"docs/using/event-types.html","title":"Event Types","body":"Event Types\nThe object containing the information describing an event is called an \nevent type.\nTo publish events an event type must exist in Nakadi.

Nakadi has an event type registry \nAPI that lists all the available event types.\nEvent Types and Categories\nThere are three main categories of event type defined by Nakadi - \n\nUndefined Event: A free form category suitable for events that are entirely custom to the producer.\n\nData Change Event: An event that represents a change to a record or other item, or a new item. Change events are associated with a create, update, delete, or snapshot operation. \n\nBusiness Event: An event that is part of, or drives a business process, such as a state transition in a customer order. \n\n\nEach event category enables different capabilities for an event type, notably their schema and validation rules, which we&#39;ll describe next.\n\nEvent Type Schema and Effective Schema\nThe events for the &#39;business&#39; and &#39;data&#39; categories have their own pre-defined \nschema structures, based on JSON Schema, as well as a schema that is defined \ncustom to the event type when it is created. The pre-defined structures \ndescribe common fields for an event and the custom schema for the event is \ndefined when the event type is created.  \nThe schema for an event type is submitted as a JSON Schema and will only declare the custom part of the event. This means the pre-defined schema for \nthe &#39;business&#39; and &#39;data&#39; categories don&#39;t need to be declared (and should not \nbe declared). The &#39;undefined&#39; category has no-predefined schema.\nWhen an event for one of these categories is posted to the server, it is \nexpected to conform to the combination of the pre-defined schema and to the \ncustom schema defined for the event type, and not just the custom part of the event. This combination is called the effective schema and is validated by Nakadi for the &#39;business&#39; and &#39;data&#39; types.\nThe &#39;undefined` category behaves slightly different to the other categories. Its effective schema is exactly the same as the one created with its event type definition (it has no extra structure), but it is not validated by Nakadi. Instead an &#39;undefined&#39; event type&#39;s schema is simply made available in the event type registry for consumers to use if they wish.\nThe custom schema for an event type can be as simple as \n{ &quot;\\additionalProperties\\&quot;: true } to allow arbitrary JSON, but will usually \nhave a more specific definition :)\nCreating an Event Type\nAn event type can be created by posting to the /event-types resource. \nThis example shows a business category event type called order_received:\ncurl -v -XPOST http://localhost:8080/event-types -d &#39;{\n  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;order_received&quot;,\n  &quot;owning_application&quot;: &quot;acme-order-service&quot;,\n  &quot;category&quot;: &quot;business&quot;,\n  &quot;partition_strategy&quot;: &quot;random&quot;,\n  &quot;enrichment_strategies&quot;: [&quot;metadata_enrichment&quot;],\n  &quot;schema&quot;: {\n    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;json_schema&quot;,\n    &quot;schema&quot;: &quot;{ \\&quot;properties\\&quot;: { \\&quot;order_number\\&quot;: { \\&quot;type\\&quot;: \\&quot;string\\&quot; } } }&quot;\n  }\n}&#39;\n\nThe event type has a simple JSON Schema submitted as an escaped JSON string describing the order number and thus only declare the custom part of the schema. The partition_strategy \nsays events will be randomly allocated to partitions, and the owner&#39;s name is \n&quot;acme-order-service&quot;. The enrichment_strategies array says to apply metadata_enrichment to submitted events (common metadata is a feature of some categories). \nA successful request will result in a 201 Created response. \nOnce an event type is created, it is added to the event type registry and its details are visible from its URI in the registry. Events can then be posted to its stream and consumed by multiple clients. \nThe exact required fields depend on the event type&#39;s category, but name, owning_application and schema are always expected. The \n&quot;API Reference&quot; contains more details on event types.\nPartitions\nAn event type&#39;s stream is divided into one or more partitions and each event is placed into exactly one partition. Partitions preserve the order of events - once an event is added to a partition its position relative to other events in the partition is never changed. The details of the partitions and their offsets for an event type are available via its /partitions resource.\nPartition Ordering\nEach partition is a fully ordered log, and there is no global ordering across partitions. Clients can consume a stream&#39;s partitions independently and track their position across the stream.\n\nDividing a stream this way allows the overall system to be scaled and provide \ngood throughput for producers and consumers. It&#39;s similar to how systems such as Apache Kafka and AWS Kinesis work. \nPartition Strategies\nThe assignment of events to a partition is controllable by the producer. The \npartition_strategy field determines how events are mapped to partitions. Nakadi offers the following strategies:\n\nrandom: the partition is selected randomly and events will be evenly distributed across partitions. Random is the default option used by Nakadi.\n\nhash: the partition is selected by hashing the value of the fields\ndefined in the event type&#39;s partition_key_fields. In practice this means events that are about the same logical entity and which have the same values for the partition key will be sent to the same partition.\n\nuser_defined: the partition is set by the producer when sending an event. This option is only available for the &#39;business&#39; and data&#39; categories.\n\n\nWhich option to use depends on your requirements. When order matters, hash is usually the right choice. For very high volume streams where order doesn&#39;t matter, random can be a good choice as it load balances data well. The user defined option is a power tool, unless you know you need it, use hash or random.\n"},"docs/using/producing-events.html":{"url":"docs/using/producing-events.html","title":"Producing Events","body":"Producing Events\nPosting an Event\nOne or more events can be published by posting to an event type&#39;s stream. \nThe URI for a stream is a nested resource and based on the event type&#39;s name - for example the &quot;widgets&quot; event type will have a relative resource path called /event-types/widgets/events.\nThis example posts two events to the order_received stream:\ncurl -v -XPOST http://localhost:8080/event-types/order_received/events -d &#39;[\n  {\n    &quot;order_number&quot;: &quot;24873243241&quot;,\n    &quot;metadata&quot;: {\n      &quot;eid&quot;: &quot;d765de34-09c0-4bbb-8b1e-7160a33a0791&quot;,\n      &quot;occurred_at&quot;: &quot;2016-03-15T23:47:15+01:00&quot;\n    }\n  }, {\n    &quot;order_number&quot;: &quot;24873243242&quot;,\n    &quot;metadata&quot;: {\n      &quot;eid&quot;: &quot;a7671c51-49d1-48e6-bb03-b50dcf14f3d3&quot;,\n      &quot;occurred_at&quot;: &quot;2016-03-15T23:47:16+01:00&quot;\n    }\n  }]&#39;\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\nAs shown above, the event stream accepts an array of events. \nValidation Strategies and Effective Schema\nEach event sent to the stream will be validated relative to the effective schema for the event type&#39;s category. \nThe validation behavior and the effective schema varies based on the event type&#39;s category. For example, because the example above is a &#39;business&#39; category event type, as well as the fields defined in the event type&#39;s original schema, the events must also contain a metadata object with an eid and occurred_at fields in order to conform to the standard structure for that category.\nOnce the event is validated, it is placed into a partition and made available \nto consumers. If the event is invalid, it is rejected by Nakadi.\nEnrichment Strategies\n@@@TODO\nEvent Ordering\nThe order of events in the posted array will be the order they are \npublished onto the event stream and seen by consumers. They are not re-ordered \nbased on any values or properties of the data. \nApplications that need to order events for a particular entity or based on a identifiable key in the data should configure their event type with the hash partitioning strategy and name the fields that can be used to construct the key. This allows partial ordering for a given entity.\nTotal ordering is not generally achievable with Nakadi (or Kafka) unless the partition size is configured to be size 1. In most cases, total ordering is not needed and in many cases is not desirable as it can severely limit system scalability and result in cluster hot spotting.\nDelivery versus Arrival Order\nNakadi preserves the order of events sent to it (the &quot;arrival order&quot;), but has \nno control over the network between it and the producer. In some cases it \nmay be possible for events to leave the producer but arrive at Nakadi in a \ndifferent order (the &quot;delivery order&quot;). \nNot all events need ordering guarantees but producers that do need end to end \nordering have a few options they can take:\n\nWait for a response from the Nakadi server before posting the next event. This trades off overall producer throughput for ordering.\n\nUse the parent_eids field in the &#39;business&#39; and &#39;data&#39; categories. This acts as a causality mechanism  by allowing events to have &quot;parent&quot; events. Note the parent_eids option is not available in the &#39;undefined&#39; category. \n\nDefine and document the ordering semantics as part of the event type&#39;s scheme definition such that a consumer could use the information to sequence events at their end.\n\n\n"},"docs/using/consuming-events.html":{"url":"docs/using/consuming-events.html","title":"Consuming Events","body":"Consuming Events\nConnecting to a Stream\nA consumer can open the stream for an Event Type via the /events sub-resource. For example to connect to the order_received stream send a GET request to its stream as follows:\ncurl -v http://localhost:8080/event-types/order_received/events\n\nThe stream accepts various parameters from the consumer, which you can read about in the &quot;API Reference&quot;. In this section we&#39;ll just describe the response format, along with how cursors and keepalives work.\nHTTP Event Stream\nThe HTTP response on the wire will look something like this (the newline is show as \\n for clarity):\ncurl -v http://localhost:8080/event-types/order_received/events \n\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/x-json-stream\n\n{&quot;cursor&quot;:{&quot;partition&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:&quot;6&quot;},&quot;events&quot;:[...]}\\n\n{&quot;cursor&quot;:{&quot;partition&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:&quot;5&quot;},&quot;events&quot;:[...]}\\n\n{&quot;cursor&quot;:{&quot;partition&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:&quot;4&quot;},&quot;events&quot;:[...]}\\n\n\nNakadi groups events into batch responses (see the next section, &quot;Batch Responses&quot; for some more details). Batches are separated by a newline and each available batch will be emitted on a single line. If there are no new batches the server will occasionally emit an empty batch (see the section &quot;Event Stream Keepalives&quot; further down).\nTechnically, while each batch is a JSON document, the overall response is not valid JSON. For this reason it is served as the media type application/x-stream-json rather than application/json. Consumers can use the single line delimited structure to frame data for JSON parsing.\nBatch Response Formats\nA pretty-printed batch object looks like this -\n{\n  &quot;cursor&quot;: {\n    &quot;partition&quot;: &quot;0&quot;,\n    &quot;offset&quot;: &quot;4&quot;\n  },\n  &quot;events&quot;: [...]\n}\n\nEach batch belongs to a single partition. The cursor object describes the partition and the offset for this batch of events. The cursor allow clients to checkpoint their position in the stream&#39;s partition. Note that individual events in the stream don&#39;t have cursors, they live at the level of a batch. \nThe events array contains a list of events that were published in the order they arrived from the producer. Note that while the producer can also send batches of events, there is no strict correlation between the batches the consumer is given and the ones the producer sends. Nakadi will regroup events send by the producer and distribute them across partitions as needed.\nCursors and Offsets\nBy default the /events resource will return data from all partitions of an event type stream and will do so from the end (or &quot;tail&quot;) of the stream. To select only particular partitions and a position in the stream to start, you can supply an X-Nakadi-Cursors header in the request:\ncurl -v http://localhost:8080/event-types/order_received/events \\\n  -H &#39;X-Nakadi-Cursors: [{&quot;partition&quot;: &quot;0&quot;, &quot;offset&quot;:&quot;12&quot;}]&#39;\n\nThe X-Nakadi-Cursors header value is a JSON array of cursors. Each cursor in the array describes its partition for the stream and an offset to stream from. \nThe offset value of the cursor allows you select where in the stream partition you want to consume from. This can be any known offset value, or the dedicated value begin which will start the stream from the beginning. For example, to read from partition 0 from the beginning:\ncurl -v http://localhost:8080/event-types/order_received/events \\\n  -H &#39;X-Nakadi-Cursors:[{&quot;partition&quot;: &quot;0&quot;, &quot;offset&quot;:&quot;begin&quot;}]&#39;\n\nEvent Stream Keepalives\nIf there are no events to be delivered the server will keep a streaming connection open by periodically sending a batch with no events but which contains a cursor pointing to the current offset. For example:\ncurl -v http://localhost:8080/event-types/order_received/events \n\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/x-json-stream\n\n{&quot;cursor&quot;:{&quot;partition&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:&quot;6&quot;},&quot;events&quot;:[...]}\\n\n{&quot;cursor&quot;:{&quot;partition&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:&quot;6&quot;}}\\n\n{&quot;cursor&quot;:{&quot;partition&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:&quot;6&quot;}}\\n\n{&quot;cursor&quot;:{&quot;partition&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:&quot;6&quot;}}\\n\n\nThis can be treated as a keep-alive control.\n"},"docs/using/clients.html":{"url":"docs/using/clients.html","title":"Client Libraries","body":"Clients\nNakadi does not ship with a client, but there are some open source clients available that you can try:\n\n\n\nName\nLanguage/Framework\nGitHub\n\n\n\n\nNakadi Klients\nScala &amp; Java\nhttps://github.com/zalando/nakadi-klients\n\n\nReactive Nakadi\nScala/Akka\nhttps://github.com/zalando/reactive-nakadi\n\n\nFahrschein\nJava\nhttps://github.com/zalando-incubator/fahrschein\n\n\nTarbela\nJava\nhttps://github.com/zalando/tarbela/\n\n\n\nWe&#39;ll add more clients to this section as they appear.

Notably we&#39;ll compare it to Apache Kafka, as that&#39;s a common question, but also look briefly at some of the main cloud offerings in this area.\n\nApache Kafka\nGoogle Pub/Sub\nAWS Kinesis\nAzure EventHub\nConfluent Platform\n\n\nApache Kafka\nRelative to Apache Kafka, Nakadi provides a number of benefits while still leveraging the raw power of Kafka as its internal broker. \n\nNakadi has some characteristics in common with Kafka, which is to be expected as the Kafka community has done an excellent job in defining the space. The logical model is basically the same - streams have partitions, messages in a partition maintain their order, and there&#39;s no order across partitions. One producer can send an event to be read by multiple consumers and consumers have access to offset data that they can checkpoint. There are also some differences. For example Nakadi doens&#39;t expose Topics as a concept in its API. Instead there are Event Types that define structure and ownership details as well as the stream. Also consumers receive messages in batches and each batch is checkpointed rather than an individual message.\n\nNakadi uses HTTP for communications. This lets microservices to maintain their boundaries and avoids forcing a shared technology dependency on producers and consumers - if you can speak HTTP you can use Nakadi and communicate with other services. This is a fairly subtle point, but Nakadi is optimised for general microservices integration and message passing, and not just handing off data to analytics subsystems. This means it needs to be available to as many different runtimes and stacks as possible, hence HTTP becomes the de-facto choice.\n\nNakadi is designed to support autonomous service teams. In Zalando, where Nakadi originated, each team has autonomy and control of their microservices stack to let them move quickly and take ownership. When running on AWS, this extends all the way down - every team has their own account structure, and to ensure a level of security and compliance teams run standard AMIs and constrain how they interact to HTTPS using OAuth2 access controls. This means we tend to want to run any shared infrastructure as a service with a HTTP based interface. Granted, not everyone has this need - many shops on AWS won&#39;t have per-team account structures and will tend to use a smaller number of shared environments, but we&#39;ve found it valulable to be able leverage the power of systems like Kafka in a way that fits in with this service architecture. \n\nAn event type registry with schema validation. Producers can define event types using JSON Schema. Having events validated against a published schema allows consumers to know they will.  There are projects in the Kafka ecosystem from Confluent that provide similar features such as the rest-proxy and the schema-registry, but they&#39;re slightly optimised for analytics, and not quite ideal for microservices where its more common to use regular JSON rather than Avro. The schema registry in particular is dependent on Avro. Also the consumer connection model for the rest-proxy requires clients are pinned to servers which complicates clients - the hope for the Nakadi is that its managed susbcription API, when that&#39;s available, will not require session affinity in this way.\n\nInbuilt event types. Nakadi also optional support for events that describe business processes and data changes. These provide common primitives for event identity, timestamps, causality, operations on data and header propagation. Teams could define their own structures, but there&#39;s value in having some basic things that consumers and producers can coordinate on independent of the payload, and which are being checked before being propagated to multiple consumers.\n\nOperations is also a factor in Nakadi&#39;s design. Managing upgrades to systems like Kafka becomes easier when technology sits behind an API and isn&#39;t a shared dependency between microservices. Asychronous event delivery can be a simpler overall option for a microservice architecture compared to synchronized and deep call paths that have to be mitigated with caches, bulkheads and circuit breakers.\n\n\nIn short, Nakadi is best seen as a complement to Kafka. It allows teams to use Kafka within their own boundaries but not be forced into sharing it as a global dependency.\n\nGoogle Pub/Sub\nLike Nakadi, Pub/Sub has a HTTP API which hides details from producers and consumers and makes it suitable for use as a microservices backplane. There are some differences worth noting:\n\nPub/Sub lets you acknowledge every message individually rather than checkpointing a position in a logical log. This approach makes its model fairly different to the other systems mentioned here. While it implies that there are no inbuilt ordering assurances it does allow consumers to be very precise about what they have received. \n\nPub/Sub requires a susbcription to be setup before messages can be consumed, which can then be used to manage delivery state for messages. In that sense it&#39;s not unlike a traditional queuing system where the server (or &quot;broker&quot;) manages state for the consumer, with the slight twist that messages have a sort of random access for acknowledgements instead of competing for work at the top of queue. Nakadi may offer a similar subcription option in the future via a managed API, but today consumers are expected to manage their own offsets.\n\nPub/Sub uses a polling model for consumers. Consumers grab a page of messages to process and acknowlege, and then make a new HTTP request to grab another page. Nakadi maintains a streaming connection to consumers, and will push events as they arrive.\n\nPub/Sub uses a common envelope structure for producing and consuming messages, and does not define any higher level structures beyond that.\n\n\n\nAWS Kinesis\nLike Nakadi and Pub/Sub, AWS Kinesis has a HTTP API to hide its details. Kinesis and Nakadi are more similar to each other than Pub/Sub, but there are some differences.\n\nKinesis expose shards (partitions) for a stream and supplies enough information to support per message checkpointing with semantics much like Kafka and Nakadi. Nakadi only supplies checkpointing information per batch of messages. Kinesis allows setting the partition hash key directly, whereas Nakadi computes the key based on the data. \n\nKinesis uses a polling model for consumers, whereas Nakadi maintains a streaming connection Kinesis consumers use a &quot;shard iterator&quot; to a grab pages of message, and then make a new HTTP request to grab another page. Kinesis limits the rate at which this can be done across all consumers (typically 5 transactions per second per open shard), which places an upper bound on consumer throughput. Kinesis has a broad range of choices for resuming from a position in the stream, Nakadi allows access only from the beginning and a named offset.\n\nKinesis uses a common envelope structure for producing and consuming messages, and does not define any higher level structures beyond that. Payload data is submitted as an opaque base64 blob.\n\nAWS restrict the number of streams available to an account to quite a low starting number, and messages can be stored for a maximum of 7 days whereas Nakadi can support a large number of event types and the expiration for events is configurable.\n\nKinesis supports resizing the number of shards in a stream wheres partition counts in Nakadi are fixed once set for an event type.\n\n\n\nAzure Event Hub\n@@@ todo\n\nConfluent Platform\n@@@ todo\n"},"docs/api-spec-generated/overview.html":{"url":"docs/api-spec-generated/overview.html","title":"API Reference","body":"Nakadi API Definition\nAPI Reference\nThe Nakadi API is specified using an Open API definition.

Validation rules are evaluated \nin the order they are defined and the Event is rejected in the \nfirst case of failure. If the offending validation rule provides \ninformation about the violation it will be included in the \nBatchItemResponse. If the EventType defines schema validation it \nwill be performed at this moment.\n\nOnce the validation succeeded, the content of the Event is updated \naccording to the enrichment rules in the order the rules are defined \nin the EventType. No preexisting value might be changed (even if \nadded by an enrichment rule). Violations on this will force the \nimmediate rejection of the Event. The invalid overwrite attempt \nwill be included in the item&#39;s BatchItemResponse object.\n\nThe incoming Event&#39;s relative ordering is evaluated according to the \nrule on the EventType. Failure to evaluate the rule will reject \nthe Event.\n\n\nGiven the batched nature of this operation, any violation on validation \nor failures on enrichment or partitioning will cause the whole batch \nto be rejected, i.e. none of its elements are pushed to the\nunderlying broker.\nFailures on writing of specific partitions to the broker might \ninfluence other partitions.

Each EventStreamBatch contains an array \nof Events and a Cursor signalling the end of the array \n(i.e. the latest delivered Event). The cursor might specify the offset \nwith the symbolic value BEGIN, which will open the stream starting \nfrom the oldest available offset in the partition.\nCurrently the application/x-json-stream format is the only one \nsupported by the system, but in the future other media types may \nbe supported.\nEach EventStreamBatch belongs to a single partition as indicated by \nits cursor.\nThe initialization of a stream can be parameterized in terms of size \nof each chunk, timeout for flushing each chunk, total amount of \ndelivered Events and total time for the duration of the stream.\nNakadi will keep a streaming connection open even if there are no \nevents to be delivered. In this case the timeout for the flushing of \neach chunk will still apply and the EventStreamBatch will\ncontain only the Cursor pointing to the same offset.
