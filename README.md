# Nakadi

Nakadi is a distributed, open source event broker. The project is being developed by [Zalando](https://zalando.github.io/) and is available on [Github](https://github.com/zalando/nakadi). 

### Why Nakadi?

The goal of Nakadi is to enable convenient development of event-driven applications and asynchronous microservices by allowing producers to publish streams of event data to multiple consumers, without direct integration. It does this by exposing a [HTTP API](/api/nakadi-event-bus-api.yaml) to let microservices to maintain their boundaries and not force a particular technology dependency on producers and consumers - if you can speak HTTP you can use Nakadi.

Operations is also a factor behind Nakadi's design. Managing upgrades to systems like Kafka becomes easier when technology sits behind an API and isn't a shared dependency between microservices. Operationally, asychronous event delivery can be a simpler overall option for a microservice architecture compared to synchronized and deep call paths that have to be mitigated with caches, bulkheads and circuit breakers. 

### Features

- **A secured HTTP API.** This allows microservices teams to maintain service boundaries, and not directly depend on any specific message broker technology. Access to the API can be managed and secured using OAuth scopes.

- **An event type registry.** Events sent to Nakadi can be defined with a schema and managed via a registry. Events can be validated before they are distributed to consumers.
 
- **Inbuilt event types.** Nakadi also has optional support for events describing business processes and data changes using standard primitives for identity, timestamps, event types, and causality. 

-  **Low latency event delivery.** Once a publisher sends an event using a simple HTTP POST, consumers can be pushed to via a streaming HTTP connection, allowing near real-time event processing. The consumer connection has keepalive controls and support for managing stream offsets. 

- **Compatibility with the [STUPS project](https://stups.io/).** STUPS is Zalando's open source platform infrastructure for running and securing microservices on AWS.

- **Built on proven infrastructure.** Nakadi uses the excellent [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) as its internal message broker and the also excellent PostgreSQL as a backing database.
